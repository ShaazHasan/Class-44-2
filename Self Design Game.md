| Rules Of The Game                 | *The Cube can be controlled by all the four arrow keys *As soon as the game starts, the whole map starts to get covered with gas from the bottem *There will be 3 different types of Dot Makers which shoots toxic palets that harm the Cube in impact *If the Cube touches the gas storm, he dies *After the Cube gets infected by the gas, or gets hit by the palet from the Dot Maker, a RETRY bottun pops up in end stage which resets the game and give the player a fresh start. |
| Game Adaptivity                   | As there are 3 Dot Makers around the map, each of them have a stall between the time they shoot a palet out. And the higher the Cube climbs, the shorter the stalling time gets between each palet that come out. |
| Balance Feature (Fair Play)       | Yes, there is fair play in this game as the game will be built in way where it gets easy to hard depending on how long you keep playing the game. |

| Story Of The Game                 | The Cube is trapped in a maze and has a very well idea of where the traps (Dot Makers) are. His goal is to escape the maze by avoiding the gas that followes the Cube. |
| Skill VS Chance                   | The faster the player is able to move the arrow keys up, down, left, right. The stall time between each palet those Dot Makers shoot. |
